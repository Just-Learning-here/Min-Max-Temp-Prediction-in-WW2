# Min-Max-Temp-Prediction-in-WW2
This project analyzes historical weather data from World War Two to determine if there is a relationship between daily minimum and maximum temperatures. The goal is to visualize the data and build a simple predictive model using linear regression to estimate maximum temperature based on the minimum temperature.
