# Min-Max-Temp-Prediction-in-WW2
Overview:
This project analyzes historical weather data from World War Two to determine if there is a relationship between daily minimum and maximum temperatures. The goal is to visualize the data and build a simple predictive model using linear regression to estimate maximum temperature based on the minimum temperature.

Dataset

Source: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smid80/weatherww2/data]

Time Period: World War Two (1940-1945)

Features:

Minimum Temperature (°C)

Maximum Temperature (°C)


Methodology:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Scatter plot of minimum vs. maximum temperature

Identifying trends visually

Linear Regression Model

Fitting a linear regression model to predict max temperature

Evaluating the model using R-squared


Results:

The scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation between minimum and maximum temperatures.

A simple linear regression model provides a reasonable estimate for predicting maximum temperatures.

The analysis answers two key questions:

Is there a relationship between minimum and maximum temperatures? Yes, a strong positive correlation exists.

Can we predict the maximum temperature given the minimum temperature? Yes, using a simple linear regression model.
